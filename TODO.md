# TODO - WINDOWS 10 - SUBLIME.T3


1. Finish don patch meme feature
2. Add perhaps some more custom meme feature, such as !meme thinkguy 'THIS IS TOP TEXT' 'BOTTOM TEXT'
3. Write some unit test, are they really necessary for a discord bot?
4. Create a bot-features-request in the discord and have the bot get every message that gets approved (perhaps by a :tick: emote
from admins and somehow have that uploaded in this file. Is that even possible? Probably yes.
5. ... elipsis should not be a python thingy, ain't cool.
